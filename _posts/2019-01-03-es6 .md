Here in this article I will go throgh the concept of backpropogation and at the end of this article my goal is to give complete mathematical and intuative understanding of backpropogation to the reader.

Backpropogation is the technique of tarining neural networks and there are plethora of articles explaining it, but still I found it difficult to understand. It is true that today to train a model you do not require mathematical understanding of neural network I think solid understanding of it will help immensely understanding the behaviour of model.

If you've already read all those titles and you feel pretty comfortable with the topics they cover, it's time we dive into the evolution of JS to explore all the changes coming not only soon but farther over the horizon.

## `let` Declarations

However, we can now create declarations that are bound to any block, called (unsurprisingly) *block scoping*. This means all we need is a pair of `{ .. }` to create a scope. Instead of using var, which always declares variables attached to the enclosing function (or global, if top level) scope, use `let`:

{% highlight js %}
var a = 2;

{
    let a = 3;
    console.log( a );   // 3
}

console.log( a );       // 2
{% endhighlight %}
